Toy project to play with Rust language for the first time. It can poll from, and put to, Kafka through http copying behavior of java kafka client (thanks to wireshark + debug of java client) when connnecting to single broker with 1 topic and 1 partition. Can be used to glean some basics on how to use [kafka-protocol-rs](https://github.com/tychedelia/kafka-protocol-rs) library. Modify code in "tests.rs" to run example. This branch uses tokio TcpStream.
